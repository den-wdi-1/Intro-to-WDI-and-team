# Intro to WDI and Team

## WeWork (10 min)

### WiFi

Please use the WeWork Wifi network. The password is on the whiteboard.

### Parking

Parking is not easy around General Assembly and WeWork. The following options are available:
- If you can take public transit, bike, or walk to work, it will lower your stress levels significantly, and probably save you some money.
- If you are **really** lucky, there is free street parking on Platte Street. Go down 17th Street to Platte, and turn left.
- There is also free parking across the highway, but long-term spots are, well, spotty.
- We **highly** recommend downloading the SpotHero app.  It usually has a lot within 5-minutes walk of WeWork for $5-6 / day, but there are no guarantees.  You may end up spending as much as $10 / day.

### Using WeWork Space

- There are a lot of businesses here at WeWork. Please be mindful of your neighbors, their space, and their things.
- The water, coffee, and tea are free. Drink as much as you want.
- If you want to use an open conference room, please be aware that others may reserve the room, and please be respectful and leave if they ask.
- The darts, ping-pong tables, and other communal spaces are also available. Again, just be mindful of your neighbors and share.
- The food in the Honesty Market across from the bar is available for purchase. It's not free, but you can use your credit card to purchase things.
- Similarly, if you see any food on the kitchen/cafe tables, please ask the WeWork staff if you can have some.
- You can use the fridge in the kitchen/cafe for drinks or food. Please put your name on anything, and the date you put it in. WeWork will clean the fridge every Friday at 3pm. Also, if you see unclaimed food or drink in the fridge, please ask the WeWork staff if you can have some.
- If you are bringing guests to the space, please notify the front desk.
- Unless there is a GA event, doors at WeWork close at 6pm. Developers are welcome to stay during operating hours but if WeWork is closed be aware that you may be locked out if you leave.

## Getting to Know Your Fellow Developers and Consultants (60 min)

### Team Name Choice

 - Today, we will choose a Developer Team name.  Since we will be pretty nerdy the next three months (we probably were already), the Consultants have been brainstorming on three themes.
 - Now, we will continue the brainstorming, and vote on our favorite name.
 - Theme 1: Star Wars
  - e.g. Jedi, Sith
 - Theme 2: Lord of the Rings
  - e.g. Rivendell, Mordor
 - Theme 3: Game of Thrones
  - e.g. Stark, Lannister, Winterfell

### Introductions

 - Consultants introductions
 - Developers introductions
 
### Trivial Pursuit

 - This activity will require you to answer some really difficult questions.  See how many you can answer on your own. No cheating.  Laptops closed and phones away, please.  Take 5 minutes.
 - Now get into groups of 4 (2 can turn around to face other 2).  See how many more you can get answered.  Take 5 minutes.
 - Now ask Professor Google.  See how many more you can get answered.  Take 2 minutes.
 - Let's talk about what we learned.  Any big takeaways?
 
### One Cool Thing

 - Throughout this first week, we are expecting you to learn one cool thing about one of your fellow Developers every day.  Since you already have a group to share with, share your one cool thing with the group.
 - Now that we know some cool things about each other, tell the whole class one cool thing you learned about one of your group members.  No repeats, please.
 - We have just done a "Whip-Around", which is another activity we will do a few times in this class.

### Values

 - One thing we want to agree on for this training cohort is a set of values.
  - As an individual, take 5 minutes to choose 8 values from the list below that you think are most important.
  - Now, take another couple minutes to choose the top 2 from that list.
  - Send those two values to the #wdi-den-june channel.
  - The Consultants will compile this into a value statement for the team this week.

### Goals
 - Another thing we want to establish are growth goals for each student.  Take the next 5 minutes to come up with:
  - One personal project goal that you would like to see built or be able to build by the end of this training.
  - One personal general goal that you would like to accomplish by the end of this training.
  - Send those two goals to the #wdi-den-june channel.
  - The Consultants will compile this into a goal list for the team this week, so that we can all help each other reach them by the end of the training.
