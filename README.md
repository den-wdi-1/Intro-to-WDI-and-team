# Intro to WDI and Team

## WeWork

### WiFi

Please use the WeWork Wifi network. The password is on the whiteboard.

### Parking

Parking is not easy around General Assembly and WeWork. The following options are available:
- If you can take public transit, bike, or walk to work, it will lower your stress levels significantly, and probably save you some money.
- If you are **really** lucky, there is free street parking on Platte Street. Go down 17th Street to Platte, and turn left.
- There is also free parking across the highway, but long-term spots are, well, spotty.
- We **highly** recommend downloading the SpotHero app.  It usually has a lot within 5-minutes walk of WeWork for $5-6 / day, but there are no guarantees.  You may end up spending as much as $10 / day.

### Using WeWork Space

- There are a lot of businesses here at WeWork. Please be mindful of your neighbors, their space, and their things.
- The water, coffee, and tea are free. Drink as much as you want.
- If you want to use an open conference room, please be aware that others may reserve the room, and please be respectful and leave if they ask.
- The darts, ping-pong tables, and other communal spaces are also available. Again, just be mindful of your neighbors and share.
- The food on the Honor Bar is available for purchase. It's not free, but you can use your credit card to purchase things.
- Similarly, if you see any food on the kitchen/cafe tables, please ask the WeWork staff if you can have some.
- You can use the fridge in the kitchen/cafe for drinks or food. Please put your name on anything, and the date you put it in. WeWork will clean the fridge every Friday at 3pm. Also, if you see unclaimed food or drink in the fridge, please ask the WeWork staff if you can have some.
- If you are bringing guests to the space, please notify the front desk.
- Unless there is a GA event, doors at WeWork close at 6pm. Developers are welcome to stay until 9pm, but be aware that you will be locked out if you leave.
